Include your templates asynchronously and load their contents using websockets
in [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).

## How does this work?

This library includes javascript code in the **ws_include** template_tag.

That javascript code opens a websocket connection (WS_INCLUDE_WEBSOCKET)
that sends a websocket message including the encrypted query and the block ID of
the template that must be loaded asynchronously.

Later, the server responds with the rendered template and the corresponding block ID.
The javascript code uses the block ID to identify were to include the rendered template.

This project is an optimization of
[django-async-include](https://github.com/diegojromerolopez/django-async-include/),
project that while has the same philosophy, it uses HTTP requests to get the
rendered templates, so it is less efficient than using a lone websocket connection.
You are encouraged to take a look to that project to help you understand the aim
of this project.

## Installation

[This package is in pypi](https://pypi.org/project/django-ws-include/).
Use pip to install it:

```shell
pip install django-ws-include
```

### Installation in your Django project

Include channels and ws_include in your project's **settings.py**:

```sh

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ## ...
    'channels',
    'ws_include',
]

```

### Create asgi.py file with django-ws-include routes

```python
import os

from channels.auth import AuthMiddlewareStack
from channels.routing import ProtocolTypeRouter, URLRouter
from django.core.asgi import get_asgi_application
from ws_include.routing import websocket_urlpatterns

os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'your_project.settings')

application = ProtocolTypeRouter({
    "http": get_asgi_application(),
    "websocket": AuthMiddlewareStack(
        URLRouter(
            websocket_urlpatterns
        )
    )
})

```

## Use

Load the **ws_include** template tags at the top of your file and use the **ws_include**
template tag as a replacement of the django include template tag.

You have to pass the local context explicitly to the async included templates, so you can pass all variables you
need in your included template as named parameters of the **ws_include** template tag.

```html

{# Load the ws_include template tag at the top of your template file #}
{% load ws_include %}

{# Call the ws_include template tag indicating what objects needs to replace it #}
{% ws_include "<path of the >" <object1_name>=<object1> <object2_name>=<object2> ... <objectN_name>=<objectN>  %}
```

There is also a repository with a full example that also uses django-async-include:
[django-async-include-example](https://github.com/diegojromerolopez/django-async-include-example).

### Warning and limitations
See [django-async-include](https://github.com/diegojromerolopez/django-async-include) warnings and limitations.

## Examples

### Passing an object

```html
{% load ws_include %}

{# .. #}

{# Load the template and informs the board object is required for the included template  #}
{% ws_include "boards/components/view/current_percentage_of_completion.html" board=board %}
```

### Passing a QuerySet

```html
{% load ws_include %}

{# .. #}

{% ws_include "boards/components/view/summary.html" board=board member=member next_due_date_cards=next_due_date_cards %}
```

## Customization

### Block wrapper html tag

Wrapper tag is **div** and maybe you don't want that. Set **html__tag** optional parameter to the name of
the tag you need in that particular context.

Example:

```html
{% load ws_include %}

{# .. #}

{# Will be replaced by <li></li> block instead of <div></div> #}
{% ws_include "boards/components/view/last_comments.html" board=board html__tag='li' %}
```

### Block wrapper html tag class

Customize the wrapper class by passing **html__tag__class** optional parameter to the template tag.

```html
{% load ws_include %}

{# .. #}

{# Will be replaced by <li></li> block instead of <div></div> #}
{# Class last_comments will be added to wrapper class #}
{% ws_include "boards/components/view/last_comments.html" board=board html__tag='li' html__tag__class='last_comments' %}
```
